### Detailed Guide
See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for complete step-by-step instructions.

### Deployment Scripts
- `./deploy-setup.sh` - Prepares project for GitHub deployment
- `./cloudflare-setup.sh` - Configures Cloudflare D1 database and services

## üìù Development Notes
- The application uses British English throughout the interface
- All AI responses are constrained to uploaded document content only
- Database is automatically initialised with default business segments
- Local development uses SQLite, production uses Cloudflare D1
- Multiple file types supported with graceful error handling
- The system prioritises simplicity and can be extended with additional features

## üîê Security Considerations
- All user uploads are processed server-side
- No sensitive data is stored in browser storage
- AI responses are limited to uploaded business content
- Database uses parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection
